# CV Task1

This repository contains the code for CV Task1. Just because it seems weird to not have the source code anywhere.
And yes everything was done by me (Tobias Niedermaier)

## Installation

The final implementation of the augmenter can be found in augmenterv6.py. I know I should have done it with git from the start, but well I am lazy. Also source code does not count towards the grade, so the GitHub Repository should also not count towards it.
The Evaluation can be found in angels.py (I know spelling).
